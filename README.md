# Linkedin-Feed-Filter
uBlock filters to remove annoyances such as "likes this" in your Linkedin feed

Add the lines in filter.txt to uBlock origin (open the dashboard and tab to My Filters)

It also allows hiding of subscribed groups

Note that sometimes you have to scroll down the feed before uBlock will remove all the matches
